# JSIT
This is the codebase for the Joint Sparse method for Imaging Transcriptomics, as described in our publication _Optimization-Based Decoding of Imaging Spatial Transcriptomics Data_, published in _Bioinformatics_.
JSIT accurately "decodes" raw data from imaging-based spatial transcriptomics methods like MERFISH and STARmap, including data imaged at lower magnification levels, allowing an increase in throughput.
